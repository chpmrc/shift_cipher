# Shift Cipher

This program breaks a given (shift) ciphertext by using a dictionary attack. It supports spurious keys (i.e. two or more keys that lead to the same ciphertext for two or more different plaintexts).

## Usage

Must have python interpreter installed.

From a terminal:

`python shift_cipher.py path_to_ciphertext path_to_dictionary`
